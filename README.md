Pokemon Group Gym
This is the second part of a two-part Pokemon project. The first part was a personal pokedex to display hand-selected Pokemon, using html, css and javascript. The second project, Pokemon-Group-Gym, synthesized the personal pokedex of two users and combined them into a gym setting. This project featured battling pokemon, displayed in a Victorian-era gymnasium.
